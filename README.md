# Android--Fire-Chat

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this Application.
A simple Android chat app is an application that allows users to exchange text messages with each other in real-time. The app typically consists of a simple interface with a chat window where users can type and send messages to each other, and a list of active conversations.
